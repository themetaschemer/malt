@title[#:tag "non-diffable-fns"]{Non-differentiable extended numerical functions}

Non-differentiable versions of the functions in @secref{diffable-fns}. These functions
don't accept duals or return duals. They are primarily used to seek better memory
performance where automatic differentiation is not required.
